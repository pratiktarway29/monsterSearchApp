# monsterSearchApp

This project focused on enhancing my comprehension of rendering and data fetching within the React ecosystem. This project is built using functional components, hooks, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. It employs the `fetch` API to retrieve data from an external source and follows a component-based structure.
